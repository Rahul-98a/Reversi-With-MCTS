# Reversi with Monte Carlo tree search
Implementation of the Reversi board game, with an AI opponent that makes moves using the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm.

Game.java will allow you to play the reversi game against an AI opponent that makes it moves using the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm.
Simulation.java will run N simulations of the MCTS AI against a modified version of the MCTS AI. This modified version of the MCTS algorithm has additional logic included that should allow it to perform better than pure MCTS. The game is played N times to completion, and the results are shown for how many games each algorithm won.
